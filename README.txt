== Installation ==


The plugin can be installed via the normal Wordpress method. However, if this is not available you can also these other methods:

If you have set up FTP access:

*  Go to Wordpress admin, mouse over plugins, click "Add new", then click "Upload" at the top of the screen.

*  Click "choose file", find the zip file, and click "install now", then follow the on-screen instructions.

If you have not set up FTP access, or if there are problems with the above unzip the plugin to /wp-content/plugins/

After installation, the plugin has several options you may wish to change:

*  Open the Wordpress admin dashboard.

*  Select Plugins > Installed Plugins

*  Underneath 51Degrees.com Device Detection, select 'Activate'

*  Select Settings > 51Degrees.mobi

*  Create rules to handle different types of mobile device. [See user guide for details](http://51degrees.com/Support/Documentation/PHP/Distributions/Wordpress.aspx "Wordpress User Guide").


**Theme Developers**

1. After selecting settings:

*  Go to your theme's folder ('twentyfourteen' by default)

*  Open the index.php file and within a php tag add:

` global $_51d;
 echo $_51d['IsMobile'];`

*  You should see the value as a string, 'True' or 'False'.

*  You can use var_dump($_51d) to see all the properties available, or check our [property guide] (http://51degrees.com/Resources/Property-Dictionary "Property dictionary").

*  You can use the session variable to prevent theme switching, useful for providing a 'view desktop button'.

` $_SESSION['NO_SWITCH'] = true;	// The user will no longer be switched. `
